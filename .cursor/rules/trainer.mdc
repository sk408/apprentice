# Audiometry Trainer Project Rules

## Project Structure
- This is a Vite TypeScript application for audiometry training
- Recently updated from CRA
- Employs MUI (Material UI) for UI components
- Uses Three.js for 3D rendering (specifically for ear models)
- Uses Chart.js and Recharts for data visualization

## Component Organization
- `src/components/` contains reusable UI components
- `src/pages/` contains route-level page components
- `src/services/` contains business logic and data fetching
- `src/hooks/` contains custom React hooks
- `src/types/` and `src/interfaces/` contain TypeScript type definitions
- `src/constants/` contains app-wide constants and configuration

## Code Conventions
- React functional components with hooks are preferred
- TypeScript interfaces should be used for props and state
- Component files should be named in PascalCase
- Components should have focused responsibilities (single responsibility principle)
- MUI components should be used for consistent styling
- Chart components should use a consistent color scheme

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Audiogram component handles auditory test data visualization
- Testing interface components manage user interaction during tests
- 3D ear models use Three.js through React Three Fiber
- Patient data follows specific medical terminology and structure
- REMChart handles Real Ear Measurement visualization

## Important Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application routes
- `src/components/TestingInterface.tsx` - Core testing functionality
- `src/components/Audiogram.tsx` - Visualizes audiometry results
- `src/components/ThemeContext.tsx` - Theme management
- `src/components/GuidancePanel.tsx` - User instructions and guidance

## Common Patterns
- Use of useState and useEffect for state management
- Context API for theme and possibly other global states
- Pages typically contain layout and pull in specific feature components
- 3D components handle their own state but may receive config props

## Code Examples

### Component Pattern
Components generally follow this pattern:
```tsx
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props defined with TypeScript interfaces
  propName: PropType;
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  propName,
  optionalProp = defaultValue
}) => {
  // State hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialState);
  
  // Effect hooks
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effects logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Helper functions
  const handleEvent = () => {
    // Event handling logic
  };
  
  // Component render
  return (
    <Container>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </Container>
  );
};
```

### Audiogram Component
The Audiogram component is central to visualizing hearing test results:
```tsx
interface AudiogramProps {
  thresholds: ThresholdPoint[];
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  showLegend?: boolean;
  title?: string;
  compareThresholds?: ThresholdPoint[]; 
  currentFrequency?: number;
  currentLevel?: number;
  toneActive?: boolean;
  onPositionClick?: (frequency: number, level: number) => void;
  interactive?: boolean;
}
```

### Theme Context
The application uses React Context for theme management:
```tsx
interface ThemeContextProps {
  darkMode: boolean;
  setDarkMode: (mode: boolean) => void;
  highContrastMode: boolean;
  setHighContrastMode: (mode: boolean) => void;
  fontSize: string;
  setFontSize: (size: string) => void;
  includeAirConduction: boolean;
  setIncludeAirConduction: (include: boolean) => void;
  includeBoneConduction: boolean;
  setIncludeBoneConduction: (include: boolean) => void;
}
```

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
- Frequency is measured in Hz (125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000)
- Hearing level is measured in dB HL (decibels Hearing Level)
- Air conduction testing uses symbols: 'O' for right ear, 'X' for left ear
- Bone conduction testing uses symbols: '<' for right ear, '>' for left ear
- Real Ear Measurement (REM) helps verify hearing aid fitting
- Otoscopy refers to examination of the ear canal and ear drum
