## Technical Details

### Built With

- **React 19.0.0**: Modern frontend framework for building the UI
- **TypeScript 4.9.5**: Type-safe JavaScript for more robust code
- **Material UI 6.4.6**: UI component library for a professional look and feel
- **React Three Fiber 9.1.0**: React renderer for Three.js to create 3D visualizations

### Key Features Implementation

#### Audio Generation
The application uses the Web Audio API through the `AudioService` to generate pure tones at specific frequencies and intensities. The service includes calibration settings to simulate real audiometric equipment.

#### Testing Procedures
The `TestingService` implements the Hughson-Westlake procedure (5-up, 10-down method) used in standard audiometric testing. It tracks user responses and determines hearing thresholds based on the testing protocol.

#### Virtual Patients
Virtual patients with different hearing profiles are defined in the `PatientService`. Each patient has specific thresholds at different frequencies, simulating various types of hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, mixed, etc.).

#### Interactive Visualizations
The application provides interactive visualizations including:
- 2D audiograms for plotting hearing thresholds
- 3D ear anatomy model for educational purposes
- Real-ear measurement charts
- Otoscopy visualizations

#### Theming and Accessibility
The application supports both light and dark modes through a custom theme provider. Accessibility features include high contrast options and keyboard navigation.

#### Data Storage
The application uses browser local storage to save:
- User settings and preferences
- Test results and progress
- Recently used virtual patients

## For AI Assistants

This section provides key information to help AI assistants understand and interact with this codebase:

### Key Concepts in Audiology
- **Pure Tone Audiometry**: Testing hearing using pure tones at various frequencies and intensities
- **Hughson-Westlake Procedure**: A standardized method for determining hearing thresholds (5-up, 10-down protocol)
- **Audiogram**: A visual representation of hearing thresholds across different frequencies
- **Masking**: Technique to prevent crossover hearing during testing
- **Real Ear Measurement**: A technique for verifying hearing aid performance in the ear canal
- **Otoscopy**: Examination of the ear canal and tympanic membrane
- **Contour Test**: Speech audiometry test to determine speech recognition thresholds

### Data Structures
The application uses TypeScript interfaces to define its data structures:
- `HearingProfile`: Represents a virtual patient with specific hearing thresholds
- `ThresholdPoint`: A single point on the audiogram representing a specific hearing threshold
- `TestSession`: A testing session tracking the user's progress through the procedure
- `TestResult`: The outcome of a testing session including accuracy metrics

### Application Flow
1. User selects a virtual patient or procedure from the home screen
2. The application loads the appropriate testing interface
3. User performs the testing procedure following the onscreen guidance
4. The application tracks user actions and provides feedback
5. Results are displayed and stored after completion
